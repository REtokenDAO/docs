## for Everyone

Housing is a human right. Thant being said, the global need of affordable housing is alarming. Owning a home and even rent is now out of reach for sectors in our society in all major cities. This brings about unrest in socio-political environment that may destabilize the very fabric of humanity. We at REtoken aims to reverse this phenomenon by making housing affordable and allowing citizens of this world to take equity ownership in any part of the world by taking part in token investment and distribution. Along with this format each token holder can earn passive income. We want to bring back dignity and sustainability in home ownership. We aim to achieve housing as a human right for everyone. We extend this invitation to you and help us make this a reality for a better world.
