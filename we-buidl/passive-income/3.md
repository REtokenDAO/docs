## We #BUIDL Passive Income with Real Estate for Everyone

Welcome to the "Passive Income" section of our Lite Paper.

## Passive Income

We define "passive income" as income that is generated with minimal to no effort required. By tokenizing real estate assets, REtoken DAO has the ability to create passive income opportunities with a low barrier-to-entry.

Tokenized real estate (much like traditional real estate) generates profits through one of two ways - price appreciation and rent. As the real estate asset increases in value, the price of an individual token also increases in value. And when a tenant pays rent, that rent will be splut up and distributed to token holders based un how many tokens they hold relative to the amount of tokens created to represent the whole asset.

In this way, tokenized real estate assets allow anyone to gain exposure to the real estate market and start earning passive income without being accredited investors or having large amounts of capital.
