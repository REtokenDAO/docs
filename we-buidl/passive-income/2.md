## We #BUIDL Passive Income with Real Estate investing for Everyone

During our [White Paper Working Groups](../../participate/working-groups/white-paper-working-groups.md), we decided and thought that it would be fun to create this Lite Paper with five sections.

Welcome to the _**#BUIDL**_ section of our Lite Paper.

1. 👥｜[We](1.md)
2. 🛠｜[#BUIDL](2.md)
3. 💰｜[Passive Income](3.md)
4. 🏡｜[with Real Estate investing](4.md)
5. 👥｜[for Everyone](5.md)

## #BUIDL

BUIDL is an intentional misspelling of the word BUILD, in the same fashion as HODL. It is considered a call to action to build and contribute to the blockchain and to crypto projects instead of just holding assets. These users prefer contribution to the community in order to help adoption and to grow and improve the ecosystem. A few ways that REtoken is BUIDLing include their flagship project, TokenTown, holding a virtual summit, and putting together an NFT-based fractionalized Real Estate Certification program, which will be a 3-tiered progression model.
