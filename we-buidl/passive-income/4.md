## What is Real Estate?

Real Estate is property consisting of land and buildings along with any natural resources such as minerals and crops contained within a specified area of land. Real Estate generally consists of immovable property that is affixed to the land.

## Why Invest in Real Estate?

Investing in Real Estate is a multi-faceted method for obtaining income. First, Real Estate that is carefully selected in desirable locations tends to increase in value over time. This is known as equity and can be used as collateral to finance projects or is received in cash at the time of Real Estate sale. Second, Real Estate can be rented to tenants in exchange for cash or other value. Finally, Real Estate allows for significant tax benefits to reduce the tax burden of owners. REtoken DAO seeks to leverage the benefits of each of these areas to generate income for holders.
