## We #BUIDL Passive Income with Real Estate for Everyone

During our [White Paper Working Groups](../../participate/working-groups/white-paper-working-groups.md), we decided and thought that it would be fun to create this Lite Paper with five sections.

Welcome to the _**with Real Estate**_ section of our Lite Paper.

1. 👥｜[We](1.md)
2. 🛠｜[#BUIDL](2.md)

## What is Real Estate?

Real Estate is property consisting of land and buildings along with any natural resources such as minerals and crops contained within a specified area of land. Real Estate generally consists of immovable property that is affixed to the land.

## Why Own Real Estate?

Owning Real Estate is a multi-faceted method for obtaining passive income. First, Real Estate that is carefully selected in desirable locations tends to increase in value over time. This is known as equity and can be used as collateral to finance projects or is received in cash at the time of Real Estate sale. Second, Real Estate can be rented to tenants in exchange for cash or other value. Finally, Real Estate allows for significant tax benefits to reduce the tax burden of owners. REtoken DAO seeks to leverage the benefits of each of these areas to generate income for holders.

## REtoken DAO’s Real Estate Approach

REtoken DAO’s operating model is focused on delivering a WIN/WIN/WIN framework. We are looking to create tokenized Real Estate that is community-owned. Our shared-equity approach provides opportunities for ownership to residents and seeks to provide financial benefits to a broader community.
