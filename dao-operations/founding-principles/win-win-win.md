# Win / Win / Win

What is a win / win / win situation?  Ask yourself this question ... is everyone involved in this equation better off because of this situation that we are creating?

When we are talking about tokenizing Real Estate, we have a huge opportunity to create wins for everyone involved in the Real Estate equation unlike never before.  Instead of us helping landlords scale out their rental operations through tokenization, we are wanting to create community owned housing with a shared equity appreciation model for the persons living within the housing.
